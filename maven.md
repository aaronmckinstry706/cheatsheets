# Maven Stuff

I need to...

* build only specific Maven subprojects within a larger Maven project: `mvn install --projects <dir-name>`.

* build specific Maven subprojects within a larger Maven project, as well as all modules required by this project: `mvn install --projects <dir-name> --also-make`.
